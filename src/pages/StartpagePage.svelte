            without any server-side processing.
            So your files you edit are all saved within your
            browser and will never be uploaded.

            1. On the top left of the page you have the burger menu which allows you to navigate to the different sub
            pages which all feature different ffmpeg tools.
        </div>
        <div>
            2. On the top of the page you can select the file you want to process.
            Note that each sub page you are on filters the input file types on its own which means it can happen that
            you have files selected but these can't be processed.
        </div>
        <div>
            3. After processing files the output will be shown at the bottom of the page.

    <div class="card todo">
        <h2>TODO for me</h2>
        <div>1. Can't process files twice. A feature where the processed files will be re-applied to the input files would be useful for chaining multiple tools.</div>
        <div>2. Make error handling easier like a abstract method which checks file properties (e.g. available audio or video stream)</div>
        <div>3. Create a toast message component which can show important messages.</div>
